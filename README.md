Hello there!
Im OakJoke. (name originated though bruteforcing non-existing names)
I occasianally develop games in C/C++.
I dont know what to say at this point so Im just going to say that writing html on a german kayboard layout hurts my hands.
Im also usually not a 10X dev so I wouldnt expext technological masterpieces.
